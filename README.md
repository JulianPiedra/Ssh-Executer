# Ssh-Executer

This program lets you execute commands on a different machine through SSH, based on the machine's IP. 
It includes a database (MSSQL) to save commands, and server information can be restored with the script/backup in the `DataBaseRestore` folder.  
After restoring the database, start the program and change the server information in the Server configuration tab, once this is done you can start saving and executing the commands.
