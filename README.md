# Ssh-Executer

This program lets you execute commands on a different Linux machine through SSH, based on the machine's IP. It includes a database to save commands, and server information can be restored with the script/backup in the `DataBaseRestore` folder.  
After restoring the database, change the database credentials in the `SshExecuter.dll.config` file in the extracted zipped directory.
