# Ssh-Executer

This program lets you execute commands on a different machine through SSH, based on the machine's IP. 
It includes a database (MSSQL) to save commands and server information, it can be restored with the script/backup in the `DataBaseRestore` folder in the downloaded file.  
After restoring the database, start the program and change the server information in the Server configuration tab, once this is done you can start saving and executing the commands.
